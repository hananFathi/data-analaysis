Smartwatch Fitness Analysis
OVERVIEW
In the highly competitive smartwatch industry, understanding user fitness patterns is crucial for product development and user engagement. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing fitness details of users, providing insights into their activity levels throughout the week.

Dataset
The provided dataset (dailyActivity_merged.csv) includes information on users' daily fitness activities. Each record includes details such as Totalsteps, calories , and other relevant metrics.

Objectives
Identify Inactivity Patterns:

Determine the most inactive day(s) based on the average step count.
Pinpoint the least active periods to better understand user behavior.
Highlight Active Days:

Identify the most active day(s) based on the average step count.
Explore correlations between high activity levels and external factors (e.g., weekends, holidays).
Additional Findings:

Explore correlations between different fitness metrics (calories burned, distance covered, etc.).
Investigate trends in specific age or gender groups.
Visualize daily and weekly patterns to uncover trends or anomalies.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebooks
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file (fitness_analysis.ipynb) to execute the analysis.
Explore the findings and visualizations generated from the dataset.
Results
The project outcomes, including visualizations and key insights, are available in the Jupyter Notebook. The findings aim to provide valuable information for most active and inactive days.
